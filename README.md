# Tree_Jacker
A folder analysis program with gui in PySimpleGUI

Tree Jacker is a simple program designed to help organize large file archives and eliminate redundant files to help you store files more efficiently and protect
against data loss. Tree Jacker features a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use, and a stand alone .exe port. The stand alone should work on most
machines, but it has been specifically built and tested in a windows environment. This project was built using Python 3.8.3. The GUI environment was built using
the tkinter version of PySimpleGui. The .exe port was prepared using cx_Freeze.
